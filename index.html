									      </a></h2>
									</header>
									<p>1) Grainger’s business model and strategy for growth.
										Grainger’s business model is a B2B and B2C type of business model. In terms of B2B, Grainger offers 
										businesses products which they can use for further production and for B2C, they offer to their 
										products to end users or final consumers, (Cousera.org)
										Grainger’s strategy for growth is through the acquisition of inventories from thousands of suppliers 
										to create an inventory of over 1.4million and also offering those inventories to their different 
										customer segments, which are placed in three different personas or identities as small business 
										owners, technicians in medium sized businesses and procurement departments of large 
										organizations. These customers can purchase Grainger’s inventories on their website 
										(WWW.GRAINGER.COM) and can be shipped from their many business branches in the United 
										States, (Coursera.org).
										
										2) Grainger’s online presence (website traffic trends, online presence).
										According Elizabeth Distel, the display advertising manager at Grainger, the click through rate (CTR) 
										of Grainger had a rate of 0.05 which is positive. They see visitors from Bosch’s website since the 
										campaign started which had a 40% general increase in sales for Grainger inventories, (Coursera.org).
										Grainger uses different online strategies to influence their customers. They include Paid Search, 
										Display Ad, Email Marketing, Social media channels as well as organic S.E.O. But a large share of 
										their digital budget goes to Paid Search and Display Ads, (Coursera.org).
										
										3) Grainger’s Customers (with numbers, segments, demographics, e.t.c)
										Grainger’s customers are spread across different industries ranging from health care, 
										manufacturing, government and hospitality. Over 3.5 million customers rely on Grainger for their 
										inventories, (Grainger.com). In terms of customers segments, Grainger has two major customer 
										segments which are called the purchaser and the installer. They also have verticals which comprise 
										of (new customers versus existing customers under contract and no contract), and are categorized 
										into actual or potential customers, (Coursera.org). In terms of Demography, Grainger makes more 
										80% of their revenue from 20% of their customers. These 80% comes from multi channels online of 
										paid search, Display Ad, e.t.c, to the 20% that would come from a single channel, (Coursera.org).
										
										4) Trends in Grainger customer’s purchasing pattern.
										According to Akin Fosyali, the purchasing pattern of the M.R.O industry is a very complex and 
										dynamic one which has a strict point of view and so many things are considered before a purchase is 
										made. In the M.R.O industry for example, Grainger has to market to the purchaser and the installer 
										differently because they have different needs so the challenge is how to identify those different 
										needs and create relevant messages that will satisfy those different needs, (Coursera.org).
										The Maintenance, Repair and Operations Industry in North America.
										The MRO market of North America was Valued at 150.6 billion USD in 2021 and is expected to 
										expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.5% from 2022 to 2030, 
										(Grandviewresearch.com). Various initiatives by manufacturers to attain optimum efficiency are 
										expected to drive the North American MRO market growth over the forecast period. MRO 
										distribution is one of the critical components of the industry which helps to eliminate downtime. As 
										a result, companies initiate multiple schedule and preventive maintenance processes. The U.S. 
										exhibits one of the largest MRO sectors in the world and is characterized by several leading 
										companies, (Grandviewresearch.com).
										Major Characteristics
										The overall market highlights strategies, such as mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures and 
										collaborations, to strengthen a company’s business. The MRO industry was severely hit by the 
										COVID 19 pandemic as most manufactures of non-essential goods had to shut down due to 
										government regulations. FAST DELIVERY and MAINTENANCE plays a major role in gaining clients 
										confidence. Beneficial product replacement policies and bulk orders discounts are opportunities for 
										small end-use companies. PRICE is a major decider of a supplier for small and medium scale 
										businesses. The MRO market is characterized by many end-user companies, which in turn decreases
										their bargaining power.(Grandviewresearch.com)
										Trends
										In 2021 the hydraulic power transmission product segment led the market in the MRO industry 
										accounting for more than a 12.0% share of total revenue. Due to the high demand for electric 
										components by manufacturing companies, the electric power transmission product segment is said 
										to increase in revenue over the forecast period by 3.4%, (Grandviewreseach.com)
										
										Major Players
										In 2021, the U.S dominated the North America MRO market with a revenue of 87%.

										5) BOSCH BRAND (POWER TOOLS).
										Bosch is a manufacturer of MRO (maintenance, repair and operations) products used in the building and 
										construction industry. Bosch is a strict B2B company as it only sells to large businesses or suppliers. 
										Bosch tools corporation in North America was formed in January 2003 when Robert Bosch combined his 
										North American power tool and power tool accessories divisions into one organization. The power tools 
										division of Bosch group is the world market leader for power tools and power tools accessories, and 
										each year, Bosch launches more than 100 new power tools into the market, (Boschtools.com). They 
										have a network of various suppliers that buy their products in which our client (GRAINGER) is part of, 
										(Coursera.org).
										
										6) BOSCH POWER TOOLS PRIMARY AND SECONDARY CUSTOMERS AND THEIR SPECIFIC 
										NEEDS.
										
										Primary Customers: Bosch power tools primary customers are professional users which are in the 
										building, remodeling, construction e.t.c. They are the Electricians, plumbers, blacksmiths, wall scrapers, 
										Real estate companies, e.t.c. The latter are where the advertising strategy of Bosch power tools are 
										directed at, (Coursera.org).
										
										Secondary Customers: These audiences can have a strong influence on the purchase decisions of a 
										professional user, (Coursera.org). Because B2B decision making is a very strict process and factors like 
										cost, personalization, user capability, e.t.c are considered first in the MRO industry, secondary 
										customers are very key. For example, a power tool installer can have some influence on the type of 
										power tool a procurement department or a purchaser will purchase especially in terms of user capability 
										for the installer. Customer type (primary or secondary) in the MRO industry is primarily focused on the 
										actual purchaser of the power tool.
										Specific Needs: Product cost, Product personalization, User capability, product suitability, Supplier 
										reliability, e.t.c.
										
										7) NOTICABLE TRENDS BETWEEN PRIMARY AND SECONDARY CUSTOMERS.
										Customer type (primary or secondary) in the MRO industry is primarily focused on the actual purchaser 
										of the power tool. The type of customer that Bosch would focus on would entirely depend on the type 
										of customer they had at the moment. For example, a plumber would be a primary customer if they are 
										purchasing a power tool directly from a supplier. But that same customer becomes a secondary type of 
										customer when they work for a purchaser or a procurement department because the purchase of a 
										particular brand of power tool would depend solely on the installer’s (plumber) capability to use that 
										tool.
										
										8) EXISTING PERCEPTION OF BOSCH POWER TOOLS.
										Yes, the demand for Bosch power tools is high among professional power tools users and that’s why 
										they are market leaders in power tools market.
										
										9) SWOT ANALYSIS OF THE CORDLESS POWER TOOL FOR THE NORTH AMERICAN 
										MARKET
										The particular Brand of power tool we are focusing on is CORDLESS power tools. Our objectives of this 
										SWOT analysis is to show Bosch’s cordless power tool position due to the high level of competition in 
										that power tool category.
										
										STRENGTHS
										Low production cost
										High technological know 
										how
										High market share in 
										the power tool 
										category.
										Strong brand heritage.
										
										WEAKNESS
										Same distribution 
										channels with 
										competitors.
										High level of brand 
										inconsistency and 
										switching among 
										professional users.
										
										OPPORTUNITIES
										Strong exclusive 
										partnership with 
										Grainger a major 
										supplier.
										
										THREATS
										Every market leader in 
										the power tool 
										category has a strong 
										heritage for their 
										power tools and all are 
										seeking to expand 
										beyond their own 
										heritage into the 
										heritage of other 
										market leaders.
										
										10) ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING OVERLAPS BETWEEN BOSCH AND BOSCH POWER TOOLS 
										BRAND IMAGE.
										An assumption of overlap between Bosch and Bosch power tools category is the Bosch group channeling 
										all their resources to the power tool product category. Because they have the technologically know how 
										in the power tool product category accompanied by low production cost, they have channeled more 
										than half of their resources to the power tool segment even when they manufacture other MRO 
										products like Automotive, home appliances, e.t.c.
										
										11) BOSCH POWER TOOLS ONLINE PRESENCE.
										Bosch power tools just like other big brands have social media presence on all the major social media 
										platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, You Tube and their own personal website 
										Boschtools.com. You Tube is the most active social media platform for Bosch power tools with the most 
										content engagement. Facebook has the highest number of subscribers but a low content engagement. 
										Twitter has a low content engagement, while Instagram has the lowest subscription and lowest 
										engagement. Boschtools.com has more information about product enquiry and information.

									<p>1A) IDENTIFY THE PHASE OF THE CONSUMER DECISION JOURNEY RELEVANT TO EACH 
										SCENARIO MENTIONED IN THE PROBLEM STATEMENT.
										The problem statement is Bosch power tool (Cordless Category) wanting to it sales to increase by 10% 
										by partnering with Grainger one its largest B2B suppliers. The target for Bosch and Grainger is to 
										increase sales to existing customers as well as finding new customers (Cousera.org). Using the consumer 
										decision journey (CDJ) which involves initial consideration set, active evaluation, moment of purchase, 
										post purchase experience and loyalty loop (Coursera.org). For existing customers, the phase of influence 
										in the CDJ will be focused on post purchase experience (SECOND MOMENT OF TRUTH) and the loyalty 
										loop and for potential customers the phase of influence in the CDJ will be in the initial consideration set 
										(ZERO MOMENT OF TRUTH), active evaluation, and the moment of purchase (FIRST MOMENT OF 
										TRUTH) as the primary focus (Hartman, K. 2020).
										
										1B) JUSTIFYING MAPPING SCENARIOS TO PHASES OF CDJ.
										For existing customers, post purchase experience (Warranty and E-mail content marketing) is key 
										because it will determine the loyalty loop of a professional tool user. Grainger and Bosch must satisfy 
										these customers beyond the first moment of truth if they want to achieve a 10% increase in power tools 
										(Cordless) sales. For potential customers, influencing the customers during their zero moment of truth 
										(Cost per impression display advertising) is vital because it will lead to these potential consumers to the 
										other stages of the CDJ journey which is the active evaluation and the first moment of truth which is a 
										big step to achieving the 10% sales increase.
										
										2) SPECIFIC CONCERNS CONSUMERS FACE IN EACH PHASE.
										Customer Type Concerns in CDJ Journey
										
										3) IDENTIFY AT LEAST ONE ANALYSIS FOR EACH PHASE/CONCERN COMBINATION THE FIRM 
										SHOULD PERFORM TO GAIN INSIGHTS TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS.
										Existing Customers: Analysis on post purchase experience and loyalty loop is key. Grainger and Bosch 
										must use a combination of E-mail content marketing and warranty to address any dissatisfying concern 
										that a power tool purchaser might experience post purchase. If a power tool user is satisfied, then he 
										becomes a brand advocate for Bosch power tools (Loyalty loop).
										Potential Customers: Analysis on initial consideration set, active evaluation and the moment of purchase 
										is key. Grainger and Bosch can use Cost per Impression in display advertising to create awareness in 
										other to be in the consideration set of power tool users. In terms of active evaluation, brand advocacy 
										from previous power tool users and paid content marketing is key to attract new customers looking for 
										information which can lead to the moment of purchase (first moment of truth). Home delivery service 
										and proper customer relationship management must be considered during the moment of purchase.
										
										4) IDENTIFY A BUSINESS OBJECTIVE FOR EACH SCENARIO IN THE PROBLEM 
										STATEMENT BASED ON THE ANALYSIS OF THE PREVIOUS TASK.
										1 Existing Customers
										2 Potential Customers
										Post Purchase Experience (Second 
										moment of truth): Cognitive 
										Dissonance (Dissatisfaction after the 
										purchase of a power tool.) 
										Initial consideration set (Zero 
										moment of truth): Doubt about 
										power tool capability due to getting 
										so much information and past
										experience about power tools.
										Active Evaluation: Especially in 
										terms of user ability, purchaser 
										requirement, ease of use, installer 
										requirements, e.t.c.
										Moment of Purchase (First moment 
										of truth): Comparing other power 
										tools used in the past with the 
										current one in terms of efficiency. 
										For existing customers, Warranty and E-mail content marketing is used for the analysis of post purchase 
										experience and loyalty loop in their consumer decision journey. The business objective for Bosch power 
										tools is to increase sales by 10% (Coursera.org). We can use E-mail content marketing to reposition the 
										brand image of Bosch power tools. If professional tool users, installers or purchasers experience 
										dissatisfaction (cognitive dissonance), we can use BRAND REPOSITIONING as a primary marketing 
										objective. Effective E-mail marketing content asking for customer feedback on product experience and 
										providing effective solutions through Warranty can douse the consequences of consumers of power 
										tools revisiting the CDJ. For the Loyalty loop, INCREASING LOYALTY will be the primary marketing 
										objectives which can be achieved through brand advocacy from power tool users.
										For potential customers, BUILDING AWARENESS will be a key marketing objective in the initial 
										consideration set of the CDJ which can be achieved through the use of cost per impressions in display 
										advertising. INFLUENCING CONSIDERATION will be a key marketing objective when consumers of power 
										tools are going through the active evaluation process in the CDJ which can be achieved through paid 
										content marketing and brand advocacy. IMPROVING THE SALES PROCESS will be another key marketing 
										objective in the moment of purchase of the CDJ which can achieved through fast and effective home 
										delivery service and effective customer relationship management.
										
										5) DETERMINE THE KEY QUESTIONS, TYPE OF DATA NEEDED AND DATA SOURCES FOR 
										EACH OBJECTIVES.
										Marketing 
										Objectives.
										Key Questions. Type of Data Needed and 
										Sources of Data.
										Building Awareness.
										Influencing 
										Consideration.
										Improving the Sales 
										Process.
										Brand Repositioning
										Where do consumers of 
										power tools visit often in the 
										internet?
										What publisher or publishers 
										in particular will power tools 
										users visit in the internet for 
										their contents?
										What sales incentive will 
										easily influence power tools 
										users to make that purchase?
										How can we reposition our 
										brand image in the minds of 
										power tools users?
										Secondary data Source. Data 
										Management Platform (DMP) 
										in the Ad exchange.
										Secondary data Source. Data 
										Management Platform (DMP) 
										in the Ad exchange.
										Primary Data Source. 
										Company’s past record sales 
										data.
										Primary Data Source.

										6) CREATE A PLANNING DOCUMENT FOLLOWING THE TEMPLATE DICUSSED IN THE VIDEO
										PLAN (GOAL): The goal of our analysis are our marketing objectives which are to create brand 
										awareness, influence consideration, improve our sales, reposition our brand image and increase our 
										brand loyalty.
										COLLECTING INFORMATION: By asking the where, what and how questions relating to our brand 
										objectives, we are able to identify the best sources of data information for our analysis journey.
										ANALYZE (STORY): By linking our marketing objectives (goal) with the information we collected from our 
										data sources, we are able to formulate the best story on how to achieve our set marketing objectives for 
										our audience and stakeholders.
										REORT (VISUAL FORM): We should ensure clear meaning of our story and make sure our story is short, 
										concise and accurate using the best visualization tools.</p>

									<p>1) KEY DATA YOU WILL BE COLLECTING AND ANALYZING IN THIS PROJECT.
										I will be analyzing the Grainger and Bosch dataset provided to us by the instructor. Also I plan to use the 
										current data of our client, “Grainger” from an analytics tool website called similar web 
										(www.similarweb.com) and also analyze their social media performance using an analytics tool website 
										called true social metrics (www.truesocialmetrics.com). In terms of data accessibility ease, I was denied 
										data accessibility. I could only gather the datasets information from their respective websites.
									
										3) DETAIL THE BIASES YOU FEEL ARE RELEVANT FOR THE DATA YOU ARE COLLECTING OR 
										PROPOSE TO COLLECT.
										Sampling Bias: Some samples from our Datasets from all our data sources will be prioritized over others 
										due to the KPIs we are set to achieve and the level of dataset accessibility. For example, the dataset 
										from Grainger and Bosch was highly edited, removing some vital information from the dataset. These 
										has made me to analyze what is available and also to include some form of bias in our analysis.
										Questionnaire Bias: Many information where not disclosed to us by the Grainger and Bosch executives 
										due to company data privacy laws. Some information about total revenue were excluded from the 
										Grainger and Bosch dataset allowing us to presume a revenue from the available information we got. 
										The order of answers in our interview were not direct and straightforward leading us to assume from 
										the available dataset provided. 
										Interpretation Bias: Due to biases from our datasets, interpretation bias might exist in our analysis due 
										to the unavailability of detailed information from our datasets. For example, the revenue generated 
										from the Ad spend of Grainger and Bosch dataset from me may not correspond with the revenue 
										generated from Ad spend of Grainger and Bosch data analytics team due to modifications in datasets.
									
										4) STEPS TO TAKE TO ELIMINATE BIAS.
										I) By verifying more data sources: By sourcing our datasets from other analytical sources like 
										similarweb.com and truesocialmetrics.com, we were able to try and limit our level of bias from our 
										sampling technique. According to Avinash Kaushik’s (Data quality sucks, let’s just get over it), due to 
										many factors, ranging from cookie deletion by consumers, privacy laws, deletion of third party cookies 
										e.t.c, all these factors make data sourcing limiting and can lead to bias. Therefore, a marketing analysis 
										must inform stakeholders about these limits and work with the available data they have even if it’s a 
										70% confidence level.
										II) By having participants review our results: By allowing Grainger and Bosch review our results findings 
										by asking them if our interpretations are representative of their beliefs, they can in turn give us more 
										information about the project we are working on especially if we are gathering vital and critical 
										information vital to their campaign goals.
										III) By reviewing our findings with peers: By reviewing our findings with peers, they can give us some 
										feedback on things we missed or can help us identify gaps in our arguments especially if we are handling 
										the same projects together. This in turn can help us eliminate bias and give us a high confidence level.
									
										5) DESCRIBE THE ANALYSIS YOU PLAN TO PERFORM ON THE DATA COLLECTED.
										The datasets we are conducting our analysis on are Grainger and Bosch dataset from our project 95%, 
										similar web analytics dataset of Grainger 4%, and true social metrics dataset of Grainger 1%.
										Descriptive: Our dataset from Grainger and Bosch gave us our ROAS (Return on Ad spend) as $190 and 
										our total Ad spend was $15,203. Our cost per action (CPA) is 0.01 and the highest ROAS by month was 
										April 2015 at $53.67 with twelve (12) orders followed by February 2015 at $31.99 with fifteen (15) 
										orders. We had a total order of 121 orders(conversions) throughout the year.
										Exploratory: The visualization tool we used for our dataset is the Microsoft Power BI because our 
										dataset size is small and I am familiar with it. We also used a Line chart visual to show insights.
										Casual: We tried to gain insights from our data sets by using a line chart visual to show where our 
										conversions were coming from. We found out that in our total orders (conversions), post view 
										attributed for 99% of our total orders, while post click attributed for less than 1%.
										
										6) TYPE OF BENCHMARKS WE PLAN TO USE WHILE DELIVERING OUR INSIGHTS.
										We will use three types of benchmarking which are PROCESS, PERFORMANCE AND STRATEGIC.
										Using insights from Similarweb.com we decided to benchmark the current performance of Grainger.com 
										ranked second (2) in MRO industry with that of Mscdirect.com the eleventh (11) ranked MRO website in 
										the U.S.A using current data as these data shows an advantage in current performance over Grainger.
										Process benchmarking: In terms of process, mscdirect.com has a display ad advantage of 7.7% as 
										compared to grainger.com 3.1% which is not encouraging enough to create awareness
										Performance benchmarking: Using insights from similarweb.com, we gathered that even though 
										Grainger had 10million total visits in march in contrast to mscdirect.com 1.9million, the average visit 
										duration for mscdirect.com was higher at 4:13 seconds to that of Grainger at 2:58 seconds. For us to 
										increase sales, then we need to create contents that will engage our visitors by giving them the best 
										information in an entertaining way
									
										Strategic benchmarking: Grainger will need to study the current performance of mscdirect.com to 
										understand the type of current customers wants they are addressing currently and try to adapt if they 
										want to increase the sales of Bosch power tools by 10%.</p>

									<p>1) Describe your email and display campaign for users in audience category 1(users 
										landing on Grainger.com directly).
										New Customers: Our Marketing Objectives for a particular customer can only be determined by their 
                                        position in the customer decision journey (CDJ). Our goal is to increase the sales of Bosch power tools by 
                                        10% on Grainger.com by targeting new customers that visit our website during their initial consideration 
                                        and active evaluation phase (ZERO MOMENT OF TRUTH). Our marketing objectives is to build brand 
                                        awareness for Bosch power tools and influence the considerations of these new customers visiting our 
                                        website for the very first time. To influence the consideration of these new customers, we can use our 
                                        display campaign through content marketing strategy and e-mail campaign through e-mail marketing.
                                        Content Marketing Strategy: For Grainger.com to target new customers, they must create the right 
                                        contents in other to engage these new customers searching for information on the right power tool to 
                                        buy. The goals of content marketing are achieved through engagement and relationship building 
                                        (Coursera.org). If new visitors connect with the contents of Grainger.com in the power tool category, 
                                        then they are more likely to feel the same way about Bosch power tools which is a step towards 
                                        achieving the 10% sales increase of Bosch power tools. In terms of placement, Grainger.com should 
adopt an OWNED marketing content because these new customers are visiting their website directly 
and searching for the best information they can get about power tools so it will be best if Grainger.com 
gives these new customers an unforgettable experience which in turn limits their bounce rate and 
increase their conversion rate through orders of Bosch power tools or through E-mail subscription.
E-mail Marketing: E-mail marketing is another powerful online marketing tool. Grainger can engage new 
customers who loved their contents through e-mail marketing such as e-newsletters, promotions, e.t.c 
which can achieve branding objectives and increase the sales of Bosch power tools by 10%. The goal of 
e-mail marketing is to create a form of intimacy with these new customers who have subscribed to our 
newsletters, promotions e.t.c and use it as a tool to encourage them to purchase Bosch power tools. Email marketing can create leads for new customers through conversion e-mails (follow up e-mails 
reminding customers of their interest), weekly e-newsletter. E-mail marketing is an effective 
communication tool to motivate new customers to purchase Bosch power tools which can lead to 
achieving the business objectives of increasing sales by 10%.
Current Customers: Grainger can upsell or cross sell different brands of Bosch power tools to customers 
satisfied with their post purchase experience (SECOND MOMENT OF TRUTH).
Content Marketing Strategy: According to psychologist and economics Herbert Simon, “Attention is a 
scarce resource in modern society”. Because current customers were maybe influenced by the content 
strategy of Grainger.com, Grainger can also use those same contents to make existing customers buy 
more Bosch power tools brands by giving existing customers improved or existing contents that 
attributed to their past purchase behavior. Because Grainger.com has gotten the attention of these 
current customers, they must manage their contents in the best way.
E-mail Marketing: Through house lists E-mail campaigns, Grainger can upsell other Bosch power tools 
category by sending periodic e-mails to existing customers, telling them the latest Bosch power tools 
category available using the best content strategies. 
) How E-mail and Display Campaigns will vary for the different scenarios in Audience 
Category 2. 
Scenario 1: Display Advertising on Boschtool.com using product incentives like a 5% sales discount on 
Bosch power tools. The aim is to drive power tool buyers from Bosch website to the contents of our 
website (Grainger.com).
Scenario 2: Conversion E-mails will help automate a follow up offering the Bosch power tools category 
that best fit the customer.
Scenario 3: Conversion E-mails that will drive customers to our Bosch power tools contents on 
Grainger.com can motivate these set of customers especially if our contents are captivating

4) HOW WOULD YOU KEEP THE CONTENTS ALIGNED WITH BOSCH’S BRAND ESSENCE 
AND IT PRODUCT POSITIONING IN THEIR MARKET.
Bosch power tools is the world’s market leader for power tools and power tools accessories. Through 
their furious pace of innovation and dedicated associates, Bosch launches 100 new power tools into the 
market annually (Boschtools.com). 
We can align the contents of Grainger.com with the brand essence and product positioning of Bosch 
power tools by creating contents that suits the perceptual mapping of consumers towards Bosch power 
tools. If the perceptual maps (consumer views) of consumers for Bosch power tools indicate superiority 
and quality, then Grainger has to tailor contents that will align with that perception. For example, If 
Grainger.com wants to sell a cordless screwdriver of Bosch power tools and their target market are 
interior decorators, Grainger.com can write a content blog on why interior decorators should make their 
work faster, neater and more professional. This in turn can trigger the demand for screwdrivers which 
will lead to conversion</p>

									<p>1) Describe the Research that needs to be done in other to verify and implement your 
										recommendations from the previous module.
										• Determining the Purpose of the Strategy: By determining the purpose of our strategy, we can 
										verify our implementation. The business objective of Bosch power tools is to increase sales of 
										power tools on Grainger.com by 10% and to achieve that business objective, Grainger had to 
										create a content marketing strategy for our display campaigns and a conversion and newsletter 
										e-mail strategy for our e-mail campaigns which are the working strategies from our general 
										marketing objectives.
										• Identifying our Customer Channels: The target customer channels of Grainger through the 
										given scenarios of our project are customers visiting Boschtools.com and Grainger.com
										respectively. Therefore, targeting these customers is our top goal.
										• Create Adaptable Processes: Through benchmarking the top performing competitors during the 
										quarter of the year, Grainger can always change their strategy. By benchmarking Mscdirect.com, 
										we were able to create adaptable processes to our strategy.
										• Choosing the best digital marketing tools: HubSpot were used to create good contents in-house 
										and Mailchimp was used to create to automated conversion e-mails.
										Three Research Objectives for the five Scenarios.
										The three research objectives Grainger.com used are (1) Knowing their target Audience (2) Knowing 
										their Goal (3) Knowing their Messages.
										Scenario 1: New customers that visit Grainger.com daily. Grainger wants to target these customers and 
										increase the sales of Bosch power tools on Grainger.com. If Grainger.com wants to keep the numerous 
										new customers that visit their website daily and increase the sales of Bosch power tools by 10%, then 
										they must know “the right messages” to pass across to these new customers through their content 
										marketing strategies.
										Scenario 2: Current Customers that have purchased Bosch power tools before and Grainger wants to 
										upsell more products to them. For existing customers, the research objectives of Grainger.com should 
										be focused on understanding their “target Audience”. Through the analysis of the historical data of past 
										purchases of current customers, Grainger can use the ATTRIBUTION model to attribute to the 
										touchpoints that lead to these past purchases and use these touchpoints as parameters to develop a 
										new digital marketing strategy.
										Scenario 3: Audiences that visit Boschtools.com but do not visit Grainger.com. Grainger should use a 
										sales promotion strategy like a 5% discount on all Bosch power tools for first time purchases on 
										Boschtools.com in order create awareness to Grainger.com. These discounts must be accompanied by 
										an “appealing content” display that will help the customers in their decision journeys.
										Scenario 4: Audiences that visit Boschtools.com, logs into Grainger.com and visits the Bosch tools 
										category. By knowing their overall “business goal” which is to increase the sales of Bosch power tools by 
										10%, Grainger must be flexible in finding new ways to guide their customers in their journeys. For 
										regular Grainger.com users like the above scenario, Grainger must always create interesting, novel and 
										captivating contents marketing strategies that will capture the minds of these loyal Grainger.com users 
										anytime they search for a new Bosch power tool.
										Scenario 5: Audiences that visit Boschtools.com, logs into Grainger.com but visits the plumbing section.
										Grainger.com must again “know the type of messages” to help create the awareness for Bosch power 
										tools. Conversion automated e-mails offering the best Bosch power tools will be a good strategy to 
										adopt in this scenario.
										3) List any measure taken to prevent bad user experience if the research methodology is 
										performed on Grainger/Bosch website.
										By asking customers to fill online questionnaire forms only when they want to log out.
										By not asking too much questions when new customers are signing up on Grainger.com.
										By asking only relevant questions that can help the customer in their decision journey.
										
										4) Describe the type of study or campaign you propose to the client to test your 
										campaign
										Our target focus group for Grainger.com to perform our testing is to target 15% of it new and existing 
										customers using the display advertising and e-mail marketing channels recommended from the previous 
										module.
										A/B TESTING METHOD FOR NEW CUSTOMERS: In our initial recommendation, we recommended that 
										Grainger.com should use a 5% discount offer to motivate new customers that visit Boschtools.com, but 
										do not visit Grainger.com. Through the use of A/B testing method, we can divide these new customers 
										into two groups offering different discount offerings (like buy one get one free and 5% discount for
										Bosch power tools) to understand the KPIs where the motivation of these new customers lay.
										A/B TESTING METHOD FOR EXISTING CUSTOMERS: For existing customers, we used e-mail marketing 
										channels as a recommendation. Through the A/B testing method, Grainger can use the OPEN RATE, 
										CLICK RATE and CONVERSION RATE as KPIs to understand which E-mail strategy (House-list emails or Enewsletters) best motivates their existing custom</p>
